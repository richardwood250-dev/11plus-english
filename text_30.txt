The Great Fire of London

In 1666, London was a very different city. The streets were narrow and dirty, and the houses were built of wood and packed tightly together. It had been a hot, dry summer, and the wooden houses were dry as tinder.

On the night of September 2nd, a fire started in a bakery on Pudding Lane. The baker, Thomas Farriner, had forgotten to put out the fire in his oven. Sparks flew up and set fire to the wooden house.

The fire spread quickly. A strong wind blew the flames from house to house. People panicked. They loaded their belongings onto carts and boats to escape across the River Thames. The fire burned for four days and four nights.

By the time the fire was put out, 80% of the city was destroyed. Over 13,000 houses and 87 churches, including the famous St Paul's Cathedral, were burnt to the ground. Amazingly, very few people are recorded to have died, though many were left homeless.

After the fire, King Charles II ordered that London be rebuilt. This time, the houses had to be built of brick or stone, and the streets were made wider to stop fire from spreading so easily. Sir Christopher Wren was given the job of rebuilding St Paul's Cathedral, which still stands in London today.
