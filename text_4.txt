TITLE: The Painted Door

The house had stood empty for ten years, its windows staring out like blind eyes across the moor. Villagers in the valley below spoke of it in hushed tones, claiming that on certain nights, a light could be seen flickering in the attic. But Tom didn't believe in ghosts. He believed in facts, bricks, and mortar. He had bought the old Blackwood Manor for a song, intending to renovate it and sell it for a tidy profit.

He arrived on a Tuesday, armed with a toolbox, a sleeping bag, and a large flask of coffee. The front door groaned in protest as he forced it open, revealing a hallway thick with dust and cobwebs. The air inside was cold—colder, somehow, than the wind outside.

Tom spent the first day clearing the ground floor. It was hard work, but satisfying. By evening, he had swept the main hall and set up his camp bed near the fireplace. He was just drifting off to sleep when he heard it: a soft *scratch, scratch, scratch* coming from the floor above.

He sat up, heart pounding. "Mice," he told himself firmly. "Just mice."

He grabbed his flashlight and climbed the stairs. The scratching stopped as soon as his foot hit the landing. He swept the beam of light across the peeling wallpaper and rotting floorboards. There was nothing there. Just four doors, all closed.

Wait.

He shone the light again. The door at the end of the corridor was painted a bright, fresh red. It looked wet, as if it had been painted only minutes ago. But that was impossible. No one had been here for a decade.

Tom approached slowly. The smell of fresh paint was overpowering, masking the musty scent of the old house. He reached out a hand. The handle was cold as ice. He turned it. The door swung open silently, revealing a room that wasn't dusty or decayed. It was perfectly furnished, with a fire crackling in the grate and a meal set for one on the table. And sitting in the armchair, facing the fire, was a figure.
