Lost on the Moor

The mist had descended with frightening speed, rolling off the hills like a thick, grey blanket. Ten minutes ago, Arthur had been able to see the farmhouse in the valley below, a comforting square of white against the green. Now, he could barely see his own boots.

He buttoned his jacket tighter against the damp chill. The moor, usually so wide and open, suddenly felt claustrophobic. Every gorse bush looked like a crouching beast, and the wind whistling through the heather sounded like whispering voices.

"Hello?" Arthur called out. His voice sounded thin and weak, swallowed instantly by the fog.

He knew he shouldn't have strayed from the path. His mother had warned him about the treacherous bogs that riddled the moorland, hidden traps of deep, sucking mud waiting for the unwary traveller. He tested the ground with his walking stick before every step. Squelch. Squelch.

Suddenly, a shape loomed out of the whiteness ahead. It was tall and jagged. Arthur froze, his heart pounding a frantic rhythm against his ribs. He gripped his stick like a weapon. The shape didn't move.

Arthur crept closer, holding his breath. As he got within touching distance, he let out a long, shaky sigh. It was just an old standing stone, weathered and covered in lichen. He rested his hand against the rough rock. It felt solid and real in a world that had become soft and ghostly.

Then, he heard it. A low, rhythmic thumping sound. It was getting louder. Thud-thud. Thud-thud. It wasn't his heart this time. It was hooves. Arthur pressed his back against the stone as a riderless pony galloped past, eyes wide with panic, vanishing into the mist as quickly as it had appeared.
