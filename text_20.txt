Volcanoes

A volcano is an opening in the Earth's crust that allows magma, ash, and gas to escape from beneath the surface. When magma is underground, it is called magma, but as soon as it erupts onto the surface, it is called lava.

The Earth's crust is not one solid piece. It is made up of huge slabs of rock called tectonic plates, which fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. These plates are constantly moving, though very slowly. Most volcanoes are found where these plates meet.

One famous area for volcanoes is the 'Ring of Fire'. This is a horseshoe-shaped path along the Pacific Ocean where many tectonic plates crash into each other. About 75% of the world's active volcanoes are found here.

There are three main types of volcanoes, classified by their activity. An 'active' volcano is one that has erupted recently and is likely to erupt again. A 'dormant' (sleeping) volcano is one that hasn't erupted for a long time but might erupt in the future. An 'extinct' volcano is one that scientists think will never erupt again.

Volcanic eruptions can be destructive, burying towns in ash and lava. However, they can also be beneficial. Over time, the ash breaks down to form incredibly fertile soil, which is excellent for farming. This is why many people still live near volcanoes, despite the danger.
