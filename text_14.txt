Ancient Egypt: Gift of the Nile

The ancient Egyptian civilisation is one of the most fascinating in history. It flourished for over 3,000 years in North Africa. The key to its success was the River Nile. Without this mighty river, Egypt would have been nothing but a barren desert. The Greek historian Herodotus famously called Egypt "the gift of the Nile".

Most of Egypt is hot and dry, but the land along the banks of the Nile is incredibly fertile. Every year, between June and September, the river would flood. This was known as the 'Inundation'. When the waters receded, they left behind a thick layer of black mud called silt. This silt was rich in nutrients and perfect for growing crops.

The Egyptians were expert farmers. They grew wheat and barley to make bread and beer, and flax to make linen for their clothes. They also developed a system of canals and ditches to control the water, allowing them to irrigate their fields even during the dry season.

The Nile was also a vital transport route. Boats carried goods like grain, gold, and stone up and down the river, connecting the different parts of the kingdom. It was also a source of food; fishermen caught fish in nets, and hunters caught waterfowl in the marshes.

The Egyptians worshipped the Nile as a god named Hapi. They believed that if they honoured Hapi, he would bring a good flood and a plentiful harvest.
