The Stag at the Pool

One hot summer's day, a Stag came to a pool of clear water to drink. As he bent his neck, he saw his own reflection in the water.

"What glorious antlers I have!" he exclaimed, admiring the great branching horns that grew from his head. "They are so graceful and grand. I look like a king!"

However, as he looked lower, his mood changed. He saw his legs reflected in the water. They were long, spindly, and thin.

"But my legs!" he groaned. "They are so ugly and weak. I am ashamed of them. Why could nature not give me legs as magnificent as my antlers?"

Just then, a Lion emerged from the bushes, roaring loudly. The Stag turned and fled. His long, thin legs, which he had despised moments before, carried him swiftly away. He bounded across the plain, easily outrunning the heavy Lion.

The Stag dashed into a thick forest to hide. But as he ran beneath the trees, his magnificent antlers got caught in the low-hanging branches. He struggled and pulled, but the antlers were tangled fast. The Lion, who had been trailing behind, caught up to the trapped Stag.

"Alas!" cried the Stag, as the Lion approached. "I was proud of my horns, yet they have been my undoing. I was ashamed of my legs, yet they were the only things that could have saved me."
