The School Play

Sam stared at the curtain. It was heavy, red velvet, and it smelled of dust. On the other side of that fabric were three hundred people: parents, teachers, and students. And they were all waiting for him.

"You'll be fine," whispered Maya, adjusting her costume. She was dressed as a tree. Sam was dressed as a knight, though his armour was made of cardboard painted silver, and his sword was a pool noodle wrapped in foil.

"I can't remember my first line," Sam hissed, panic rising in his chest like a bubble. "It's gone. My brain is empty."

"It's 'Halt, dragon!'" Maya said patiently. "We've rehearsed this fifty times, Sam."

"Halt, dragon," Sam repeated. "Right. Halt, dragon."

Mr. Henderson, the drama teacher, waved frantically from the wings. The music swelled – the cue for Sam's entrance. He took a deep breath. It felt like he was breathing in soup.

He stepped out onto the stage. The lights were blindingly bright, hotter than the sun. He couldn't see the audience, which was a blessing, but he could hear them. A cough. A rustle of sweet wrappers. A baby crying somewhere in the back.

Sam marched to the centre of the stage. The dragon, played by two Year 6 boys in a green sheet, waddled towards him. It was time.

"Halt, dragon!" Sam shouted. His voice squeaked slightly, but it was loud.

The dragon stopped. One of the Year 6 boys tripped, and the dragon's head wobbled dangerously. A ripple of laughter went through the audience. Sam froze. This wasn't in the script. The dragon regained its balance, but the tension was broken.

Sam looked at the dragon, then at the audience. He raised his foil sword. "And tie your shoelaces!" he ad-libbed.

The laughter grew louder, but this time it felt warm and encouraging. Sam grinned. He wasn't just reciting lines anymore; he was performing. The panic bubble popped, replaced by a rush of adrenaline. He swung his sword, ready to face the beast.
