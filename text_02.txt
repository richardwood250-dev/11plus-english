The Hidden Door

The old house had always fascinated Leo. It stood at the end of the lane, its windows like tired eyes watching the world go by. When his family moved in, Leo claimed the attic room immediately. It was dusty and smelled of old paper, but it was his.

One rainy Tuesday, while exploring a corner of the attic behind a stack of moth-eaten velvet curtains, Leo noticed something odd about the wall. The wallpaper, peeling and yellowed with age, had a vertical seam that didn't match the pattern. He ran his fingers along it and felt a cold draught. Pushing gently, a section of the wall clicked and swung inwards.

Leo's heart hammered against his ribs. It was a door, cleverly disguised. He stepped through into a narrow passageway. The air here was cooler and smelled of dried lavender. Cobwebs brushed his face like ghostly fingers as he crept forward, the floorboards groaning under his weight.

At the end of the passage was a small, circular room. It was completely empty, save for a wooden chest in the centre. The chest was bound in iron and looked incredibly heavy. Leo approached it slowly. There was no padlock. With trembling hands, he lifted the heavy lid.

Inside, there were no gold coins or jewels. Instead, the chest was filled with leather-bound books. Leo picked one up. The cover was worn, but the golden letters were still visible: 'The Diary of Barnaby Thorne, 1892'. Leo sat cross-legged on the floor and opened the book. The handwriting was spidery and rushed.

"October 31st," he read. "I have finally done it. The machine works. I can hear them talking..."

Leo turned the page, his eyes widening. Diagrams of strange cog-filled machines covered the paper. He had expected a treasure map, perhaps, or a box of old toys. But this... this was something else entirely. He didn't know who Barnaby Thorne was, but Leo had a feeling his boring summer holiday was about to get a lot more interesting.
