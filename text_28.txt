The Whispering Woods

The villagers of Oakhaven never went into the woods after dark. They said the trees had eyes, and the wind carried secrets. But Liam needed to find his lost dog, Buster, and he didn't care about silly superstitions.

He stepped past the tree line as the sun set. The shadows stretched out like long, thin fingers. "Buster!" he called. His voice sounded flat and dead among the dense trunks.

"Buster isn't here," a voice rustled.

Liam spun around. "Who's there?"

"We are," the voice replied. It seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere. Liam looked at the nearest oak tree. Its bark was gnarled and twisted, and if he squinted, the knots looked almost like a face. A very old, very sad face.

"My dog," Liam stammered. "He's small, brown..."

"We know," the trees whispered. The leaves rustled, sounding like a thousand people shushing each other. "He chased the rabbit. He went deep. Too deep."

"Where?" Liam asked, stepping closer to the oak.

A branch creaked and pointed slowly towards the north. "Beware the Stone Circle," the oak groaned. "The Old Ones do not like intruders."

Liam felt a shiver of ice run down his spine. He should go back. He should run home and hide under his duvet. But from the north came a faint, frightened bark.

"Thank you," Liam whispered to the tree, and he ran north into the gathering dark.
