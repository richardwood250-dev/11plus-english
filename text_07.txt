The Old Scarecrow

He stands alone in the field of wheat,
With muddy boots upon his feet.
His coat is torn, his hat is worn,
He watches the crops from dusk 'til dawn.

He has no voice to scare the crows,
Just a painted smile and a carrot nose.
The wind blows hard, the rain comes down,
But he never leaves his patch of ground.

In summer heat he starts to fade,
His straw poking out from the holes he’s made.
A mouse nests deeply in his vest,
Finding a warm and secret rest.

But when the winter frost bites deep,
And all the world is fast asleep,
He stands a sentry, stiff and stark,
A lonely shadow in the dark.
