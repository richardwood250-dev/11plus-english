The Winter Market

The market square was transformed. Usually a grey expanse of tarmac, tonight it was a glittering wonderland. Strings of fairy lights criss-crossed overhead, weaving a net of gold against the dark sky.

The air was thick with scents. The sharp, piney smell of Christmas trees mingled with the sweet aroma of roasting chestnuts and the rich, sugary scent of mini doughnuts frying in oil.

Stalls lined the cobblestones, each one a wooden hut overflowing with goods. There were scarves knitted from wool as soft as clouds, handmade wooden toys painted in bright primary colours, and glass baubles that caught the light and fractured it into rainbows.

People bustled everywhere, wrapped in thick coats and scarves. Their breath puffed out in white clouds as they laughed and chatted. A brass band stood near the fountain, their cheeks puffing out as they played a jolly carol. The brass of their instruments gleamed under the streetlamps.

In the centre of it all was the carousel. It spun slowly, a blur of mirrors and lights. Children sat atop the painted horses, their faces glowing with joy as they waved to parents who watched from the sidelines, clutching mugs of steaming hot chocolate.
