TITLE: The Boy Who Caught the Wind

Long ago, in a village perched on the edge of the High Cliffs, there lived a boy named Kael. The wind in the village did not just blow; it roared. It tore tiles from roofs, snapped tree branches like matchsticks, and stole washing from the lines, carrying it out to sea.

The villagers hated the wind. They built high walls and wore heavy cloaks. But Kael was different. He loved the wind. He loved how it messed up his hair and made his kite dance in the sky.

"If only we could catch it," Kael said one evening, watching his father struggle to shut the heavy oak door against a gale. "We could make it work for us."

His father laughed. "You cannot catch the wind, boy. It is wild. It belongs to no one."

Kael was determined. He spent weeks in the shed, hammering and sawing. He built a strange machine with great canvas blades, like the wings of a giant bird. He attached it to a grinding stone. The villagers shook their heads. "Kael’s Folly," they called it.

One stormy afternoon, Kael wheeled his machine to the highest point of the cliff. The wind screamed, pushing him back, but he locked the wheels in place and released the brake.

The canvas blades caught the gale. *Whoosh.* They turned. Slowly at first, then faster and faster, until they were a blur. Below, the grinding stone began to spin. Kael threw a handful of wheat grain onto the stone. Within seconds, it was ground into fine flour.

The villagers stopped laughing. Kael had not just caught the wind; he had tamed it. He had built the first windmill. From that day on, the wind was no longer an enemy, but a powerful friend that ground their corn and pumped their water.
