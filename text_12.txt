Forces and Motion

We cannot see forces, but we can see what they do. A force is a push or a pull that can make an object start moving, stop moving, speed up, slow down, or change direction. Forces can even change the shape of an object, like when you squash a piece of playdough.

One of the most famous forces is gravity. Gravity is a pulling force that attracts objects towards the centre of the Earth. It is what keeps our feet on the ground and what makes a ball fall back down when you throw it into the air. Without gravity, we would all float off into space!

Another common force is friction. Friction happens when two surfaces rub against each other. If you roll a ball across a grassy field, it will eventually stop. This is because the friction between the ball and the grass acts against the motion of the ball, slowing it down. Rough surfaces, like sandpaper or carpet, create more friction than smooth surfaces, like ice or glass.

Air resistance is a type of friction. When an object moves through the air, the air pushes back against it. A parachute uses air resistance to work. When a skydiver opens their parachute, the large surface area catches the air. This creates a lot of air resistance, which slows the skydiver down, allowing them to land safely.

Forces are measured in a unit called Newtons (N), named after Sir Isaac Newton, the scientist who famously formulated the laws of motion and gravity.
