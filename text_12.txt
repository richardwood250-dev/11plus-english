TITLE: The Guardian of the Peak

The village of Ash-hold lay in the shadow of the Grey Mountain. For generations, the elders had told stories of the Guardian—a dragon that slept within the peak. Every autumn, the villagers would leave baskets of grain and smoked fish at the foot of the mountain path. By morning, the baskets would be empty.

"It is the price of safety," the Mayor would say. "As long as the Guardian is fed, the volcano will not wake."

Jaren was twelve, and he had doubts. He had never seen a dragon. He had never even seen smoke rise from the peak. One crisp autumn evening, instead of leaving his basket and retreating like the others, Jaren hid behind a large boulder. He pulled his cloak tight against the chill and waited.

Hours passed. The moon rose, painting the rocks in silver light. Jaren’s eyelids grew heavy. Just as he was about to give up, he heard a sound. It was not the roar of a monster, nor the flap of leathery wings. It was the *clippety-clop* of hooves.

Jaren peered around the rock. Coming down the mountain path was not a dragon, but a mountain goat. It was an old goat, with one broken horn and a coat as white as snow. Behind it came another, and then a third. The goats trotted up to the baskets and began to feast on the grain.

Jaren gasped. The noise startled the animals, and they scattered back up the trail.

He stood up, his heart racing. There was no dragon. There never had been. The 'Guardian' was just a herd of hungry goats. He looked at the empty baskets, then up at the silent mountain. He felt a bubble of laughter rise in his chest. The village wasn't being protected by a mythical beast; it was just feeding the local wildlife. He turned back towards the village, wondering if anyone would believe him.
