TITLE: The Great Migration

In the northern hemisphere, as winter approaches, the weather gets colder and insects—a main food source for many birds—disappear. Birds like swallows, swifts, and cuckoos cannot survive these harsh conditions. Instead of hibernating like bears or hedgehogs, they choose a different strategy: migration. They fly thousands of miles south to warmer climates in Africa, where food is plentiful.

This journey is fraught with danger. The birds must cross the Sahara Desert, a vast expanse of sand where there is no water and nowhere to rest. They must also cross the Mediterranean Sea. Unlike land, the sea offers no safety; if a land bird stops flying, it drowns. To survive, they must store huge amounts of fat in their bodies before they leave, acting as fuel for the flight.

Scientists have long puzzled over how birds find their way. They do not have maps or GPS. Recent studies suggest that birds use a combination of tools. They can navigate using the position of the sun and stars, much like ancient sailors. Even more remarkably, it is believed that birds can sense the Earth’s magnetic field, using it like an internal compass to guide them towards the poles.

Not all birds migrate, however. Some, like the robin and the blue tit, stay behind. These birds have adapted to eat seeds and berries, which are available even in winter. They also grow thicker plumage to trap heat against their bodies. For these birds, the risk of a long journey is greater than the risk of a cold winter.

Whether they stay or go, the goal is the same: survival. The fact that a tiny swallow, weighing less than a coin, can fly from Britain to South Africa and back again is one of nature’s greatest miracles.
