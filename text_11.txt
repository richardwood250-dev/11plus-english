The Midnight Garden

The clock on the mantelpiece chimed twelve times, the sound echoing through the silent house. While the rest of the family slept, Tom sat up in bed, wide awake. He had heard the stories about the old manor house for years, but tonight he was going to see if they were true.

Slipping his feet into his cold slippers, he crept towards the window. The garden below was bathed in silver moonlight. At first, it looked like the ordinary garden he played in during the day—the swing set, the rose bushes, the garden shed. But as he watched, a soft, purple glow began to emanate from the far corner, near the old oak tree.

Tom rubbed his eyes. The glow was getting brighter. He saw flowers that weren't there in the daytime—tall, luminous lilies that seemed to hum with a low vibration. A hedge that usually looked like a box suddenly uncurled itself and stretched, shaking off its leaves like a dog shaking off water.

Then, he saw it. A creature, no bigger than a cat but with wings like a dragonfly, landed on the birdbath. It dipped a tiny hand into the water and splashed its face. Tom gasped, his breath fogging up the glass. The creature stopped and looked straight up at his window. It didn't look scared. It smiled, raised a finger to its lips, and vanished in a puff of sparkling dust.

Tom sat back on his bed, his heart racing. He knew nobody would believe him, but he also knew he would never look at the garden in the same way again.
