TITLE: The Secret Life of Bees

A honeybee hive is a masterpiece of engineering and organization. Within a single colony, there may be up to 60,000 bees, all working together in perfect harmony. It is often said that a hive functions not as thousands of separate insects, but as a single "super-organism."

There are three types of bees in the hive. First, there is the Queen. There is usually only one Queen per colony, and her sole job is to lay eggs—up to 2,000 a day in the summer. She is the heart of the hive; without her, the colony would die out.

Second, there are the Drones. These are the male bees. They have no stingers and do not gather food. Their only purpose is to mate with a new Queen.

Finally, there are the Workers. These are all females, and as their name suggests, they do all the work. They clean the hive, feed the larvae, build the hexagonal wax cells, guard the entrance, and forage for nectar and pollen.

Communication is key to their success. When a worker bee finds a good source of food, she returns to the hive and performs a "waggle dance." By moving her body in a figure-of-eight pattern and vibrating her wings, she tells the other bees exactly where the flowers are in relation to the sun.

Bees are vital to human survival. They are pollinators, meaning they help plants to reproduce. It is estimated that one-third of the food we eat—apples, almonds, strawberries, and coffee—depends on bees. Sadly, bee populations are declining due to habitat loss and pesticides. Saving them is not just about honey; it is about protecting our own future.
