The Storm

The sky turned bruised and purple-black,
As wind came howling on the attack.
It tore the leaves from trembling trees,
And whipped the whitecaps on the seas.

The thunder grumbled, low and deep,
Awaking giants from their sleep.
Then lightning cracked—a jagged scar,
That lit the landscape near and far.

The rain came down in sheets of grey,
Washing the dust of summer away.
It drummed on roofs and danced on glass,
And turned the road to a muddy morass.

The birds fell silent, the dogs did whine,
Hiding away until the sun would shine.
But in the lighthouse, steady and bright,
A beam of hope cut through the night.
