TITLE: The Stonecutter's Wish

Once, there was a stonecutter named Koji. Every day, he went to the mountain to cut blocks of stone. It was hard work. His hands were blistered, his back ached, and the sun beat down on his neck.

"I am so tired," Koji sighed one afternoon. "I wish I were the Sun. Then I would be high above the world, powerful and hot, with no one to tell me what to do."

To his amazement, a spirit in the mountain heard him. "Your wish is heard," a voice boomed.

Instantly, Koji became the Sun. He shone proudly in the sky, scorching the fields and making the farmers run for shade. He felt magnificent. But soon, a huge black Cloud drifted in front of him, blocking his light.

"The Cloud is stronger than me!" Koji cried. "I wish I were a Cloud."

Again, he changed. As a Cloud, he rained storm and flood upon the earth. But then, the Wind howled and blew him across the sky. "The Wind is stronger!" Koji shouted. "I wish to be the Wind."

As the Wind, he uprooted trees and blew roofs off houses. But when he blew against the great Mountain, the Mountain did not move. It stood firm.

"The Mountain is strongest of all," Koji gasped. "Make me the Mountain."

He became the Mountain. He stood tall and silent, unmoving against the wind and rain. He felt invincible. But then, he felt a sharp tap, tap, tap at his feet. He looked down. There, far below, was a tiny stonecutter, chipping away at his rock with a hammer and chisel.

Koji realized with a shock that the man was changing the shape of the mountain. The man was stronger than the mountain.

"I wish to be a man again," Koji whispered.

He awoke with his hammer in his hand. His back ached, and his hands were sore, but he smiled. He was Koji the stonecutter, and that was exactly who he was meant to be.
