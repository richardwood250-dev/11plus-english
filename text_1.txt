TITLE: The River's Secret

The fog did not roll into London; it sat upon the city like a heavy, wet blanket. Down by the docks, the air tasted of coal smoke and salt. Arthur pulled his threadbare collar tighter around his neck, shivering as the damp seeped through his thin jacket. He was a mudlark—a scavenger of the riverbank—and the receding tide was his clock.

Most boys his age were asleep in warm beds, or perhaps sitting in schoolrooms learning their letters. Arthur’s classroom was the freezing sludge of the River Thames. His eyes, sharp as a hawk’s, scanned the grey mud for anything of value: a lost copper coin, a piece of scrap iron, or perhaps a button dropped by a careless sailor.

"Keep your eyes down and your mouth shut," his father had always told him. "The river gives, but she takes away just as quick."

Arthur stepped carefully over a rotting driftwood log. The mud sucked at his boots with a squelching sound, threatening to pull them right off his feet. Suddenly, a glint of gold caught his eye. It was not the dull, rusty colour of old iron, but a bright, piercing spark amidst the gloom.

He fell to his knees, plunging his hands into the freezing muck. His fingers closed around something hard and circular. He pulled it out and wiped it on his sleeve. It was a pocket watch, heavy and smooth, with an intricate design of a dragon engraved on the back. It was far too valuable to be here. Rich men did not walk in the mud, and they certainly did not drop gold watches by accident.

A sudden sound made him freeze—the crunch of a heavy boot on gravel.

Arthur spun around. The fog obscured the top of the embankment, but a silhouette loomed above him. It was a tall man, wearing a long coat and holding a cane that looked suspiciously like a weapon. The man was not looking at the river; he was looking directly at Arthur.

Panic, cold and sharp, spiked in Arthur’s chest. He knew instinctively that this was not the owner coming to claim lost property. This was trouble. Shoving the watch deep into his pocket, Arthur scrambled over the slick rocks, darting under the wooden pilings of the jetty. He did not look back.
