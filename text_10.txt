TITLE: The Clockmaker's Secret

The shop smelled of oil, old wood, and patience. Tucked away in a narrow alley of Victorian London, 'Thorne & Daughter' was a place where time didn't just pass; it was constructed. Elara sat at the workbench, her magnifying loupe pressed to her eye, adjusting a spring no thicker than a human hair.

Her father, Master Thorne, was the most famous clockmaker in the city, though he rarely left the workshop. "Time is a river, Elara," he would say. "Most people just float in it. We build the dams and the bridges."

One rainy Tuesday, the bell above the door jingled. It wasn't the polite chime of a wealthy customer, but a frantic, jarring ring. A man stumbled in, his coat sodden and his hat pulled low. He placed a heavy, velvet-wrapped object on the counter.

"Can you fix it?" he rasped. "It stopped at midnight yesterday, and everything has... paused."

Elara frowned. She unwrapped the object. It was a pocket watch, but unlike any she had seen. The face had no numbers, only symbols of the zodiac, and the hands were shaped like lightning bolts. She held it to her ear. Silence. No ticking. No heartbeat.

"I need to speak to Master Thorne," the stranger insisted, his hands shaking.

"He is away," Elara lied. Her father was asleep upstairs, frail and ill. "I am the clockmaker today."

She picked up her tools. As soon as her screwdriver touched the casing, a spark of blue light jumped from the watch, stinging her fingers. The air in the shop suddenly grew heavy and still. Dust motes in the air stopped falling. The sound of the rain outside ceased. Elara looked at the stranger. He wasn't moving. He was frozen in place, a statue of fear.

She realized then that her father wasn't speaking metaphorically. They didn't just build clocks. They maintained the flow of time itself. And right now, it was broken.
