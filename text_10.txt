Our Solar System

Our solar system is a vast and busy place. At its centre is the Sun, a giant star that provides the heat and light necessary for life on Earth. Gravity keeps all the planets, dwarf planets, asteroids, and comets in orbit around the Sun.

There are eight recognised planets in our system. They are divided into two groups: the inner planets and the outer planets. The inner planets are Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. These are known as 'terrestrial' planets because they are made mostly of rock and metal. They are smaller and have solid surfaces you could stand on. Mercury is the closest to the Sun and experiences extreme temperatures, while Venus is the hottest planet due to its thick, toxic atmosphere trapping heat.

The outer planets are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. These are known as the 'gas giants'. They are massive compared to Earth and are made up mostly of hydrogen and helium gas. You could not stand on these planets as they do not have a solid surface. Jupiter is the largest planet of all, famous for its Great Red Spot, a storm that has been raging for hundreds of years. Saturn is easily recognised by its spectacular rings, which are made of ice and rock chunks.

Beyond Neptune lies the Kuiper Belt, a region filled with icy bodies and dwarf planets. The most famous dwarf planet is Pluto. For many years, Pluto was considered the ninth planet, but in 2006, scientists decided it was too small to be a full planet.

Exploring space helps us understand our place in the universe. We use telescopes to see distant worlds and send robotic probes to visit them. Who knows what secrets we might discover next?
