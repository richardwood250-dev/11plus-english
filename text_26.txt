Spring

The frost retreats, the earth awakes,
A shiver runs through frozen lakes.
The snowdrops bow their heads in white,
Brave heralds of the returning light.

The trees, once bare and skeletal grey,
Put on a coat of green today.
And in the hedge, a frantic rustle,
As nesting birds begin their bustle.

The lambs kick up their heels in play,
In fields that stretch out far away.
The sun climbs higher, bold and gold,
Chasing the shadows, defeating the cold.

New life explodes in every part,
A beating rhythm, a nature's heart.
Gone is the silence of winter's deep,
 The world has woken from its sleep.
