Bird Migration

Migration is the seasonal movement of animals from one region to another. Many birds migrate to find food, better weather, or safe places to raise their young.

In the northern hemisphere, as winter approaches, the weather gets colder and insects—a main food source for many birds—disappear. Birds like swallows and cuckoos leave the UK and fly thousands of miles south to Africa, where it is warm and food is plentiful. In the spring, when the weather in the UK warms up and insect numbers rise, the birds return to build nests and lay eggs.

The distance some birds travel is incredible. The Arctic Tern holds the record for the longest migration. It flies from the Arctic (North Pole) to the Antarctic (South Pole) and back again every year. This round trip is about 44,000 miles! Because they see the summer sun at both poles, Arctic Terns see more daylight than any other creature on Earth.

But how do birds know where to go? Scientists believe they use a combination of methods. Some use the position of the sun and stars to navigate. Others follow landmarks like rivers and coastlines. Amazingly, many birds have a built-in compass in their brains that allows them to sense the Earth's magnetic field. This helps them stay on course even when flying over the open ocean where there are no landmarks to see.
