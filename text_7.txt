TITLE: The Midnight Coach

The rain did not merely fall; it lashed against the windows of the stagecoach like handfuls of gravel thrown by an angry giant. Inside, Oliver huddled deeper into his woollen coat. The lantern swaying from the roof cast long, dancing shadows that made the passengers look like ghosts. opposite him, a large man with a bushy moustache snored loudly, oblivious to the storm.

"Do you think we are safe?" whispered the elderly lady next to Oliver. She was clutching a small, velvet bag as if her life depended on it.

"I'm sure the driver knows the road, ma'am," Oliver said, though he didn't feel sure at all. The road to York was notorious for highwaymen—bandits who struck under the cover of darkness. And tonight, the darkness was absolute.

Suddenly, the carriage lurched violently to the left. The horses whinnied in panic, and the sound of wood splintering echoed through the night. The coach ground to a halt, tilting dangerously.

The snoring man awoke with a start. "What? What is it? Have we been stopped?" His eyes darted to the window, searching for the masked face of a robber.

The door swung open, letting in a gust of freezing wind and rain. It was the driver, dripping wet. "Wheel's caught in a rut," he grunted, wiping rain from his eyes. "Axle might be cracked. I'll need strong hands to help push."

Oliver hesitated, then stood up. "I'll help."

He stepped out into the mud. It was thick and cold, oozing over his boots. Together with the driver, he put his shoulder against the splintered wood of the carriage. "On three," the driver shouted over the wind. "One... two... three!"

They pushed. For a moment, nothing happened. Then, with a groan of timber and a squelch of mud, the great wheel popped free. Oliver stumbled back, panting, his coat soaked through. He wasn't a hero fighting bandits, but as he climbed back inside, the grateful smile from the old lady made him feel ten feet tall.
