TITLE: The Red Planet

Mars, often called the "Red Planet," has fascinated humans for centuries. It is the fourth planet from the Sun and our second-closest neighbour after Venus. The planet gets its nickname from the iron oxide dust (rust) that covers its surface, giving it a distinct reddish-brown hue visible even from Earth without a telescope.

Although Mars is about half the size of Earth, it is home to geological features that are truly gigantic. It boasts the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, which stands three times taller than Mount Everest. It also has a canyon system called Valles Marineris, which is ten times longer than Earth's Grand Canyon and would stretch across the entire United States.

The atmosphere on Mars is very thin, composed mostly of carbon dioxide. This means it cannot trap heat, making the planet incredibly cold. The average temperature is a freezing minus 60 degrees Celsius. Humans could not survive there without special suits to provide oxygen and protection from the cold and radiation.

Scientists are eager to find out if life ever existed on Mars. Over the years, we have sent many robotic explorers, or "rovers," to the surface. These machines, with names like *Curiosity* and *Perseverance*, act as mobile science labs. They drill into rocks, take photos, and analyze the soil.

Recent discoveries suggest that billions of years ago, Mars was much warmer and wetter. Dried-up riverbeds and minerals that only form in water have been found. If water was once there, perhaps life was too. Today, plans are being made to send humans to Mars, a journey that would take at least six months and mark the greatest adventure in human history.
