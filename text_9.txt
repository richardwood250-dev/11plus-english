TITLE: The Forgotten Garden

Clara had been told never to open the green gate at the bottom of the garden. "It's unsafe," her grandmother had said, her lips pursed in a thin line. "Too many brambles. Too many memories." But Clara was ten years old, and the word 'unsafe' sounded terribly like 'adventure'.

One sweltering afternoon, while her grandmother dozed in the parlour, Clara crept down the lawn. The grass tickled her ankles. The gate was almost invisible, buried under a cascade of ivy. The iron rusted, cold and flaky under her fingers. She pushed. It groaned, a low, metallic complaint, and swung inward.

Clara stepped through. She expected a wasteland of weeds. Instead, she found a world held in suspense.

It was a walled garden, silent and still. In the centre stood a stone fountain, dry now, with a statue of a fish gasping for water. Rose bushes had grown wild, their thorny branches tangling together like clasped hands, but beneath the overgrowth, flashes of colour remained—stubborn poppies and brave bluebells fighting for the light.

The air here was different. It smelled of damp earth and old perfume. In the corner, a wooden bench sat under a willow tree. On the bench lay a book, its pages yellowed and swollen with damp. Clara approached it cautiously. It looked as though someone had been reading it just moments ago and had simply stood up and walked away, leaving it there for fifty years.

She reached out to touch the book, but a sudden noise made her jump—a rustle in the dry leaves. A robin, with a chest as red as a berry, hopped onto the fountain. It cocked its head and looked at her with a beady black eye. It didn't seem afraid. It seemed to be waiting.

"Hello," Clara whispered.

The robin chirped, a sharp, clear sound that broke the silence like a dropped glass. Clara smiled. This place wasn't scary. It was just lonely.
