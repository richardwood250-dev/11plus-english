The Roman Army

The Roman Army was one of the most successful and feared fighting forces in history. It allowed Rome to conquer a vast empire that stretched from England in the north to Africa in the south.

The army was highly organised. The main unit was called a 'legion', which consisted of about 5,000 men. These men were called legionaries. To be a legionary, you had to be a Roman citizen. They were professional soldiers who signed up for 25 years of service.

Roman soldiers were incredibly disciplined. They trained every day, marching up to 20 miles in full armour. Their armour included a metal helmet, a chest plate made of metal strips, and a large curved shield called a 'scutum'. Their main weapons were a short sword for stabbing and a javelin for throwing.

When attacking, the Romans used clever formations. The most famous was the 'testudo' or 'tortoise'. The soldiers would lock their shields together above their heads to create a solid roof. This protected them from arrows and rocks thrown by the enemy, allowing them to march right up to fortress walls.

The army didn't just fight; they were also excellent builders. They built thousands of miles of straight roads so the legions could travel quickly. They also built forts, walls (like Hadrian's Wall), and bridges, many of which are still standing today.
