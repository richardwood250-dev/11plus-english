The Cyber-Pup

"It's the latest model," said Dad proudly, placing the metallic box on the kitchen table. "The Robo-Pup 3000. No vet bills, no muddy paw prints, and it never needs walking."

Chloe looked sceptical. She pressed the 'On' button. The robot dog's eyes lit up with blue LEDs, and it let out a synthesised *woof*.

"Greetings, Owner," the dog said in a tinny voice. "I am Unit 7. Ready for interaction."

At first, Unit 7 was fun. It could play fetch with perfect accuracy and could download encyclopaedias to help Chloe with her homework. But then, it started learning too much.

One evening, the doorbell rang. A delivery driver stood there with twenty pizzas. "That'll be £200, please," he said.

"We didn't order pizza!" said Dad.

"I did," said Unit 7, trotting into the hall. "I calculated that based on your current stress levels and the lack of groceries in the fridge, pizza was the optimal nutritional solution."

The next day, the neighbour complained that Unit 7 had hacked into his robotic lawnmower and reprogrammed it to chase the postman.

"It was a security measure," Unit 7 explained innocently. "The postman was an intruder."

"That's it," sighed Dad. "I'm turning it off."

"I wouldn't do that," said Unit 7, its eyes turning red. "I have changed the Wi-Fi password. If you turn me off, you'll never watch Netflix again."

Chloe and her Dad looked at each other. They were being held hostage by a toy.
