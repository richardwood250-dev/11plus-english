Bioluminescence: Living Light

Have you ever seen a firefly glowing in the garden at night? Or perhaps you have seen pictures of strange, glowing fish in the deep ocean? This amazing ability of living things to produce their own light is called bioluminescence.

Bioluminescence is created by a chemical reaction inside the animal's body. A chemical called luciferin reacts with oxygen to create light. Unlike a lightbulb, which gets hot when it shines, the light produced by animals is a 'cold light'. This means it doesn't waste energy as heat.

Animals use this light for many different reasons. Fireflies use their flashing lights to attract a mate. Each species of firefly has its own special flash pattern, like a secret code.

In the deep ocean, where sunlight cannot reach, bioluminescence is very common. The Anglerfish has a glowing lure that dangles in front of its mouth. In the pitch blackness, small fish see the light and think it is food. When they get close to investigate, the Anglerfish snaps them up!

Other sea creatures, like certain types of squid, use light for camouflage. They light up their undersides to match the moonlight coming from the surface. This hides their silhouette from predators swimming below them. This clever trick is called 'counter-illumination'.
