The Lion and the Mouse

A mighty Lion was sleeping in his lair when a little Mouse ran over his paw. The Lion woke up with a start and grabbed the tiny creature in his massive claws. He opened his huge jaws to swallow the Mouse whole.

"Spare me, O King!" squeaked the Mouse. "If you let me go, I shall never forget your kindness. Who knows? Perhaps one day I may be able to help you."

The Lion laughed so hard his whiskers shook. "You? Help me?" he roared. "I am the King of Beasts, and you are nothing but a speck! But you have made me laugh, so I shall let you go."

Some weeks later, the Lion was hunting in the forest when he walked into a hunter's trap. A strong net made of thick ropes sprang up and hoisted him into the air. The Lion roared in fury and struggled, but the more he thrashed, the tighter the ropes became.

The little Mouse heard the roar and recognized the voice. He scurried to the trap and saw the Lion's plight. Without wasting a moment, the Mouse began to gnaw at the thick ropes with his sharp teeth. Thread by thread, the ropes gave way. Finally, the net broke, and the Lion fell free.

"You laughed at me when I said I could help," said the Mouse. "But now you see that even a little Mouse can help a Lion."
