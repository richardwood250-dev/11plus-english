TITLE: The Clockwork Emporium

The shop did not look like much from the outside. Tucked between a noisy bakery and a grey, imposing bank, ‘The Clockwork Emporium’ was easy to miss. Its windows were dusty, and the gold paint on the sign was peeling like sunburned skin. But for Leo, it was the only place in London that mattered.

He pushed the door open. A bell jingled—not a sharp, electric buzz, but a rich, brassy chime that seemed to linger in the air. Inside, the shop was a symphony of ticking. There were grandfather clocks standing like soldiers against the wall, carriage clocks on velvet cushions, and pocket watches hanging from the ceiling like strange, metallic fruit.

Behind the counter sat Mr. Aris. He was a man composed entirely of sharp angles: a pointed nose, pointed elbows, and a pointed beard that twitched when he concentrated. He was currently peering through a jeweller's loupe at a mess of tiny cogs scattered on black velvet.

"You’re late, Leo," Mr. Aris said, without looking up. "Time waits for no man, and certainly not for a boy who stops to stare at the bakery cakes."

Leo flushed. "I wasn't staring. I was checking the time on the town hall clock."

"That old thing?" Mr. Aris scoffed, finally raising his head. His eyes were magnified by his spectacles, making him look like a startled owl. "It loses four seconds a day. An abomination. Precision, Leo. Precision is the heartbeat of the universe."

Leo hurried behind the counter, donning his apron. He knew better than to argue. To Mr. Aris, a clock that lost time was worse than a clock that had stopped altogether. A stopped clock was honest; it made no promises. A slow clock was a liar.
