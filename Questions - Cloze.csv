CLOZE_089,Cacti,"Cacti (singular: cactus) are plants that are adapted to live in dry environments. Most cacti are found in North and South America. They look very different from other [1]. They usually have thick, fleshy stems that store [2]. This allows them to survive long periods of drought. Instead of leaves, cacti have spines. Spines help to reduce water loss and protect the plant from hungry [3]. Some cacti are small and round, while others, like the Saguaro, can grow as tall as [4]. Cacti do produce flowers, which are often large and colourful to attract pollinators like bees and [5]. Cacti are popular house plants because they are easy to look [6]. They need a sunny spot, perhaps on a window [7]. The most common mistake people make is watering them too [8]. In the wild, it might not rain for months, so cacti prefer dry soil. If they sit in water, their roots will [9]. You should only water them when the soil is completely dry. Cacti are slow-growing plants. Some can live for hundreds of [10].

The athletes were all men; women were not allowed to compete or even [3]. The events included running, wrestling, boxing, javelin, and chariot [4]. The most dangerous event was the ""pankration"", a fight with very few rules. Winners did not receive gold medals. Instead, they were given a wreath of olive leaves to wear on their [5]. They were treated like heroes when they returned to their home [6]. The ancient games lasted for over a thousand years until they were banned by the Romans. They were not revived until 1896, when the first modern Olympics were held in [7]. Today, the Olympics are the biggest sporting event in the [8]. Athletes from every nation come together to compete in peace and friendship. The Olympic torch is still lit in Olympia and carried to the host city.

They built huge stone [3] to control the country and keep the people in order. They also introduced a new language, French, which influenced the English we speak [4]. William wanted to know exactly who owned the land and animals in his new kingdom, so he sent men to count everything. The results were written down in a book called the [5] Book. The Normans also changed the way society was organised, using a system called the [6] system. In this system, the King owned all the land and gave parts of it to his barons in return for their loyalty and [7]. The barons then let peasants farm the land. The peasants had to work very hard and were not free to [8]. The Norman conquest was a major turning point in British [9]. It changed the laws, the language, and the [10].

CLOZE_142,The Human Ear,"The ear is the organ we use for hearing. It collects sound waves from the air and sends signals to the [1]. The ear is divided into three parts: the outer ear, the middle ear, and the inner ear. The outer ear is the part you can see; it acts like a funnel to catch the [2]. The sound travels down the ear canal to the eardrum. The eardrum is a thin piece of skin that vibrates when sound hits [3]. Behind the eardrum are three tiny bones called the hammer, anvil, and stirrup. These bones amplify the vibrations and pass them to the inner [4]. The inner ear contains a spiral-shaped tube called the cochlea, which is filled with fluid and tiny [5]. When the fluid moves, the hairs send electrical signals to the brain via the auditory [6]. The brain interprets these signals as sound. The ear is not just for hearing; it also helps us keep our [7]. Inside the inner ear are semi-circular canals that tell the brain which way up we are. If you spin around quickly, the fluid keeps moving, making you feel [8]. Loud noises can damage the delicate hairs in the ear and cause hearing [9].
