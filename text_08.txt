Sharks: Rulers of the Deep

Sharks are some of the most feared and misunderstood creatures on our planet. They have patrolled the oceans for over 400 million years, which means they existed long before the dinosaurs. Today, there are over 500 known species of shark, ranging from the tiny dwarf lanternshark, which is smaller than a human hand, to the massive whale shark, which can grow as long as a bus.

Contrary to popular belief, sharks are not mindless eating machines. They are intelligent and curious animals. While they are apex predators, meaning they are at the top of the food chain, most sharks do not hunt humans. In fact, you are more likely to be struck by lightning than attacked by a shark.

Sharks have incredible senses that help them hunt. Their sense of smell is legendary; some species can detect a single drop of blood in an Olympic-sized swimming pool. They also have a special sense called 'electroreception'. This allows them to detect the tiny electrical pulses given off by the muscle movements of other fish. This means a shark can find prey hiding in the sand, even in total darkness.

Unlike most fish, sharks do not have bones. Their skeletons are made of cartilage, the same flexible material found in your nose and ears. This makes them lighter and more agile in the water.

Sharks play a vital role in keeping the ocean healthy. By eating sick and weak fish, they stop diseases from spreading and keep fish populations in balance. Unfortunately, shark numbers are dropping because of overfishing. Protecting these ancient hunters is essential for the future of our oceans.
