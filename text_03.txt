The Weaving Contest

In ancient Greece, there lived a young woman named Arachne. She was famous throughout the land for her skill at weaving. People would travel from distant cities just to watch her fingers fly across the loom, creating tapestries of such beauty that they seemed to come alive. The birds she wove looked as if they might sing, and the water seemed to ripple.

However, Arachne had a major flaw: she was incredibly proud. She boasted that she was a better weaver than anyone, even Athena, the goddess of wisdom and crafts.

"Athena herself could not match my skill!" Arachne declared one day to a crowd of admirers.

Suddenly, an old woman in a grey cloak stepped forward from the crowd. "Be careful, child," the old woman rasped. "Do not offend the gods. Ask for forgiveness, and Athena may yet pardon your arrogance."

Arachne laughed. "I need no pardon. Let the goddess come and compete with me if she dares!"

The old woman threw off her cloak. It was Athena herself, tall and terrible, with eyes like grey storms. The crowd gasped and fell to their knees, but Arachne stood her ground, though her face went pale.

"Very well," said Athena. "We shall weave."

They set up their looms. Athena wove a tapestry depicting the glory of the gods and their punishments for mortals who defied them. It was a warning, beautiful and frightening. Arachne, however, wove scenes showing the gods making foolish mistakes. Her work was technically perfect, the colours vibrant and the texture soft as a cloud, but it was disrespectful.

When they finished, Athena looked at Arachne's work. She could find no fault in the weaving, which made her even angrier. Enraged by the girl's insult to the gods, Athena ripped Arachne's tapestry to shreds. She touched Arachne's forehead, and the girl was filled with such shame that she ran away.

"You shall not die," Athena declared, "but you shall spin forever."

Before the eyes of the crowd, Arachne shrank. Her fingers grew into long, thin legs, and her body became round and small. She had become the first spider, destined to weave her webs for all eternity.
