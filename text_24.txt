Mary Anning: The Fossil Hunter

Mary Anning was born in 1799 in the seaside town of Lyme Regis, England. Her family was poor, and to make money, they would scour the beach for "curiosities" to sell to tourists. These curiosities were actually fossils.

Lyme Regis is part of the 'Jurassic Coast', an area rich in fossils from the time of the dinosaurs. The cliffs there are unstable, and landslides often reveal new rocks and fossils. It was dangerous work. Mary's dog, Tray, was sadly killed in a landslide while she was working.

When Mary was just 12 years old, she and her brother discovered a massive skull sticking out of the cliff. Over months, she carefully dug it out. It was the first complete skeleton of an Ichthyosaur, a marine reptile that looked like a dolphin but was a dinosaur.

Mary went on to make many more amazing discoveries, including the first Plesiosaur and the first Pterodactyl found in Britain. Despite her incredible finds, she was rarely given credit by the male scientists of the time. They would buy her fossils and write papers about them without mentioning her name.

Today, Mary Anning is recognised as one of the most important figures in the history of palaeontology (the study of fossils). Her discoveries helped change the way we understand the history of life on Earth.
