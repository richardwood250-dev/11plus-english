From Bean to Bar: Making Chocolate

Chocolate is one of the world's favourite treats, but do you know how it is made? It starts with the cacao tree, which grows in tropical climates near the equator.

The tree produces large, colourful pods. Farmers harvest these pods and crack them open to reveal the cacao beans inside. These beans are covered in a white, sticky pulp. At this stage, they taste incredibly bitter and nothing like chocolate.

The beans and pulp are placed in wooden boxes and covered with banana leaves. They are left there for several days to ferment. During fermentation, the pulp turns into liquid and drains away, and the beans turn brown and start to develop a chocolatey flavour.

Next, the beans are dried in the sun. Once dry, they are shipped to factories all over the world. At the factory, the beans are roasted in large ovens. This brings out the full flavour. The shells are then removed, leaving behind the 'nibs'.

The nibs are ground into a thick liquid called chocolate liquor. To make the chocolate bars we eat, this liquor is mixed with sugar and milk (for milk chocolate). The mixture is smoothed and heated in a process called 'conching' before being poured into moulds to cool and harden.
