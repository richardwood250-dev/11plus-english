The Clockmaker's Daughter

Elara spent her days surrounded by the rhythmic ticking of a thousand clocks. Her father, Mr. Grimble, was the finest clockmaker in London. His shop was a maze of brass gears, swinging pendulums, and wooden cuckoos.

"Never touch the golden pocket watch on the top shelf," her father had warned her a hundred times. "It is not a toy, Elara. It is a burden."

One rainy afternoon, Mr. Grimble went out to deliver a grandfather clock to the Duke. Elara was left alone. Curiosity, like a persistent itch, drew her to the top shelf. She climbed the rolling ladder and reached for the golden watch. It was heavier than it looked, and it felt warm to the touch.

She pressed the latch, and the lid sprang open. The face of the watch had no numbers, only strange symbols that seemed to shift and swirl. The hands were not moving. Without thinking, Elara twisted the winder on the side.

Click.

Suddenly, the shop went silent. The ticking stopped. The pendulum of the grandfather clock in the corner froze in mid-swing. Elara looked out of the window. A raindrop hung suspended in the air, glittering like a diamond. A carriage on the street had stopped, the horse's hoof raised but never striking the cobbles.

Elara gasped. She hadn't just wound a watch; she had paused the world.
