TITLE: The Library of Lost Things

The door appeared on a rainy Tuesday, sandwiched between a bakery and a shoe shop. It hadn't been there yesterday. Felix was certain of that, for he walked this way to school every morning. The door was small, painted a deep, peeling blue, with a brass handle shaped like a question mark.

Curiosity, that dangerous itch, got the better of him. He pushed the door open.

He expected a shop, perhaps selling antiques or dusty books. Instead, he stepped into a cavernous hall that stretched upwards into darkness. The walls were lined with millions of small wooden drawers, each one labelled with a handwritten tag. The air smelled of old paper and forgotten memories.

"Welcome," a voice croaked. Perched on a high stool behind a desk was a man so old he looked like he was made of parchment. "You must be looking for something."

"I... I don't know," Felix stammered. "What is this place?"

"This," the old man said, waving a hand at the endless drawers, "is the Library of Lost Things. Everything that is lost ends up here. Single socks. House keys. Marbles. Homework."

Felix’s eyes widened. "Homework?"

"Aisle 4, Row Z," the man muttered. "But be careful. You may only take what belongs to you."

Felix wandered down an aisle labelled 'Toys (1995-2005)'. He pulled open a drawer marked 'Felix - 7th Birthday'. Inside lay a small, tin soldier with a missing arm. Felix gasped. He had lost this in the park years ago. He picked it up, feeling a rush of warmth. He reached for another drawer, this one labelled 'Someone Else’s Diamond Ring'. It was beautiful, glittering in the dim light.

"I wouldn't do that," the librarian’s voice echoed, though he was nowhere to be seen. "Taking what isn't yours carries a heavy price."

Felix froze. The ring felt suddenly cold, heavy as lead. He dropped it back into the drawer and shut it tight. Clutching his tin soldier, he hurried back to the entrance.

"Found it?" the old man asked, one eyebrow raised.

"Yes," Felix breathed. "Just what was mine."

The man smiled. "Then you may leave. But remember, Felix: try to keep hold of things. The library is getting full."
