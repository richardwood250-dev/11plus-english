The Crystal Cave

The map was old and crumbling, but it had led them here. Beneath the roots of the twisted banyan tree was a hole, just big enough for a person to squeeze through.

"I'll go first," said Sarah, clicking on her headtorch.

She slid down the muddy slope, the darkness swallowing her up. The air inside was cool and smelled of damp earth and ancient stone. "It's okay!" she called up. "Come on."

Ben followed, sliding down to land beside her. They stood up and shone their torches around. They were in a tunnel. As they walked deeper, the walls began to change. The dull grey rock gave way to jagged spikes of purple and white.

"Look," whispered Ben.

They stepped into a vast cavern. It was like standing inside a geode. Giant crystals, some as big as tree trunks, jutted from the floor and ceiling. When the torchlight hit them, they didn't just reflect it; they seemed to amplify it. The whole room glowed with a soft, pulsing light.

"It's singing," Sarah said.

She was right. A low, resonant hum filled the air. It wasn't a sound you heard with your ears, but one you felt in your bones. Ben reached out to touch a crystal. It vibrated against his fingertips, warm and alive.

"This isn't just a cave," Ben said, his voice trembling with awe. "It's a machine."
