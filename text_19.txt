The Empty House

"I dare you," whispered Jack, nudging Harry towards the rusty gate.

The house at the end of Elm Street had been empty for as long as anyone could remember. The windows were boarded up with jagged planks of wood, and the roof sagged in the middle like a wet cardboard box. Ivy strangled the brickwork, climbing all the way to the chimney pots.

Harry swallowed hard. The gate creaked a high-pitched protest as he pushed it open. The overgrown path was littered with dead leaves that crunched loudly under his trainers. He felt like every window was watching him.

"Go on, just touch the front door," Jack urged from the safety of the pavement.

Harry took a deep breath and stepped onto the porch. The paint on the door was peeling, revealing grey wood underneath. He reached out a trembling hand. Just as his fingertips brushed the wood, a loud *THUMP* came from inside.

Harry froze. Then came a scratching sound, like claws on floorboards.

*Scritch. Scratch. Thump.*

It was getting closer to the door. Harry turned to run, but his shoelace caught on a loose paving slab. He stumbled, falling to his knees. The handle of the door began to turn slowly. Rusty metal ground against rusty metal.

With a yelp, Harry scrambled up and sprinted back down the path, vaulting over the gate. He didn't look back until he was halfway down the street. Jack was running right beside him, his face pale.

"Did you hear that?" Jack gasped.

"Hear it?" said Harry, rubbing his grazed knee. "I almost shook hands with it."
