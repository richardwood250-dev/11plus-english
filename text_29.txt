The Emperor Penguin

The Emperor Penguin is the largest of all penguin species. They live in Antarctica, the coldest and windiest place on Earth. While other animals leave Antarctica during the harsh winter, the Emperor Penguin stays.

Their breeding cycle is incredible. The female lays a single egg and then leaves it with the male. She travels to the sea to hunt for fish, leaving the male behind for two months. During this time, the male balances the egg on his feet and covers it with a warm flap of skin called a 'brood pouch'. If the egg touches the ice, the chick inside will freeze instantly.

The males huddle together in a large group to survive the freezing winds, which can reach speeds of 100 miles per hour. They take turns standing on the outside of the huddle, where it is coldest, and moving to the warm middle. They do not eat for the entire two months.

When the female returns, she brings food for the newly hatched chick. The male, who has lost almost half his body weight, is finally free to go to the sea and eat. The parents then take turns caring for the chick until it is old enough to swim and hunt for itself.
