TITLE: Life in the Deep

When we think of the ocean, we typically picture the sunlit surface where dolphins play and coral reefs teem with colourful fish. However, this zone, known as the "sunlight zone," makes up only a tiny fraction of the ocean’s depth. Beneath it lies a world of eternal darkness, crushing pressure, and freezing temperatures: the deep sea.

The "twilight zone" begins at 200 metres down. Here, the light is so faint that photosynthesis is impossible, meaning no plants can grow. The creatures that live here have adapted in strange ways. Many have enormous eyes to capture the smallest glimmers of light. Others have transparent bodies to make themselves invisible to predators.

Deeper still, below 1,000 metres, is the "midnight zone." It is completely black. To survive here, many animals have developed bioluminescence—the ability to produce their own light. The Anglerfish, for example, has a rod-like spine sticking out of its head with a glowing tip. In the pitch blackness, curious fish are attracted to the light, only to be snapped up by the Anglerfish’s massive, tooth-filled jaws.

Food is scarce in the deep. Most creatures rely on "marine snow"—showers of dead plankton and organic waste that drift down from the surface miles above. Because meals are rare, deep-sea animals often have slow metabolisms; they move slowly and can survive for months without eating.

Despite these harsh conditions, the deep ocean is not a wasteland. In fact, scientists have discovered coral reefs in the cold dark that are thousands of years old, and giant tube worms that live near volcanic vents, surviving on heat and chemicals rather than sunlight. It is a reminder that life can thrive in the most unexpected places.
