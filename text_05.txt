The Victorian Workhouse

In Victorian Britain, life for the poor was extremely difficult. Before 1834, the poor were looked after by their local parishes, but this system was becoming too expensive. The government introduced a new law called the Poor Law Amendment Act. This law stated that if people wanted help, they had to go into a workhouse.

Workhouses were deliberately designed to be unpleasant places. The government thought that if the workhouses were awful, only those who were truly desperate would ask for help. They feared that if the conditions were too comfortable, people would become lazy and refuse to work.

Upon entering a workhouse, families were separated. Men, women, and children lived in different parts of the building and were rarely allowed to see each other. They were stripped of their own clothes and given a rough uniform to wear. Personal possessions were taken away.

The 'inmates', as they were called, had to work very hard. Men might spend hours breaking stones or crushing bones to make fertiliser. Women were often put to work in the laundry or kitchen, or picking oakum. Oakum picking involved unravelling old, tarry ropes from ships so the threads could be reused. It was painful work that made fingers bleed.

The food was terrible. The main meal was usually a thin, watery porridge called gruel. There was very little meat or vegetables. Malnutrition was common, and diseases spread quickly in the cramped, dirty conditions.

Despite the harsh treatment, many people had no choice. For orphans, the elderly, and the sick, the workhouse was the only alternative to starving on the streets. It was a grim institution that cast a long shadow over the lives of the Victorian poor.
